                                  To do list.


NICER:

- put expression modifiers into separate classes 

- provide a global customization interface to handle Namespaces 
  registration (forwarded to PHPTAL_Dom_Defs) and expression modifiers 
  insertion


OPTIMIZATIONS:

- Optimize macro calls : register known macros to avoid preparing 
  templates on each call

- tal:define with single CDATA shouldn't be output buffered, may 
  requires some refactoring


PRECOMPILED MODE:

- Pre-Compiled mode, assume every required template is compiled and up 
  to date and never do file checks

- template pre-compiler, generate PHP from templates without executing 
  them, do some checks
