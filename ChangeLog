* 2005-12-01 1.1.4
	- integrated branch 1.1.x into trunk
	- code cleanup
	- many little refactorings (not ended)
	- added namespace declaration handlers
	- fixed doctype and xml declaration discovery in deep macro calls
	- fixed, ${foo} are not interpolated anymore inside xml comments
	- added a way to propagate xml and doctype declarations keeping track of parent context in PHPTAL_Context
	- made Defs a pseudo singleton class and removed access to its static members
	- added phptal_isempty() usage in tal:content, tal:replace and tal:attributes
	- added phptal_escape() which is called by each phptal echo (except structures)
	- false booleans are now echoed as 0 instead of ''
	- malformed macro names now throws an exception
	- added object.__toString() tests
	- fixed getLastModifiedTime() call
	- replace isset() with property_exists() in phptal_path()
	- fixed single quote in string: error  (string:foo 'bar' baz)
	- fixed characters in translation keys
	- fixed latin1 characters in i18n:attributes keys
	- changed key generation relatively to I18NFool
	- fixed tal:define so following things works :
		<span tal:define="foo; bar string:x">foo value</span>
		<span tal:define="bar string:x; foo">foo value</span>
		<span tal:define="bar; foo">foo and bar value</span>
	- fixed tal:define and hidden img node bug
	- fixed double i18n:attributes html escaping
	- fixed i18n:name + xmlns error
	- fixed last path in string: not interpolated
	- tal:define and content buffering fixes (patch from William Bailey)
	- made private things protected so the class can be freely extended and modified by library users
	- fixed i18n:attributes on non i18n:translate nodes
	- fixed pre filter propagation on external macro execution
	- implemented global & local tal:define system, ***this will break some templates***
